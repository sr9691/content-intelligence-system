"""
Email Generation Workflow Graph

A LangGraph workflow that orchestrates the content recommendation
and email generation process for DirectReach prospects.

Flow:
1. analyze_intent - Extract intent signals from prospect data
2. rank_assets - Score and rank content for the prospect
3. (Future: generate_email - Create personalized email with Gemini)

MVP version: 2 nodes to prove graph execution works.
